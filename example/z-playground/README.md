# `z-playground`

<br>

This “example” is, in fact, the Dream online playground, running at
[http://dream.as](http://dream.as). *Note: the playground is still an early
prototype, and I am starting and stopping it manually.*

It's a simple, one-page app that communicates with its server by a WebSocket.
The server starts and stops Docker containers that run visitors' code. An
`<iframe>` serves as an on-page client for testing out Web apps.
