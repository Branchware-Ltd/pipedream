<!-- TODO LATER Coverage badge on coveralls; better yet, link to an online version of
     the Bisect coverage report - probably in gh-pages. Generate the badge
     from coveralls, though - it's easier to maintain. -->
<!-- TODO LATER CI badges, opam link badge, npm badge. -->
<!-- TODO Clone instructions should include --recursive. -->

## Roadmap
