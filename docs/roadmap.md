## 1.0.0 roadmap:

- Will do a bunch of `1.0.0~alphaX` releases before `1.0.0`, but all the basic things have to be in place during the alphas &mdash; they are just a chance to do breaking chanegs before the real `1.0.0`.
- Working apps.
  - ‚úÖ Servers abstracted; httpaf implementation provided (should be easy).
    - ‚úÖ Also need built-in H2, websocket.
    - üî≤ Server-sent events. This is just some example.
  - ‚úÖ Basic router &mdash; doesn't have to be fast.
    - ‚úÖ But need the basic composition story, including the path prefix middleware (almost).
    - üî≤ ~~Really should improve the router a bit before release. OTOH it might be fast enough already. However, named URL parameters are an absolute requirement~~.
  - ‚úÖ Basic template engine.
    - üî≤ Further improvements:
      - üî≤ Easy configuration.
      - üî≤ Template streaming.
      - üî≤ Escaping helpers.
  - ‚úÖ Minimal dependencies (need to vendor some things and write some glue code).
- Middleware collection.
  - ‚úÖ Logger.
  - ‚úÖ Debugger.
  - üî≤ URL templates.
  - üî≤ XSS protection helpers.
  - ‚úÖ Cookies.
    - üî≤ Needs fast parser, caching, etc.
  - ‚úÖ Sessions.
    - ‚úÖ Needs configurable back-ends, etc. Currently fixed to in-memory
    - üî≤ SQL back end.
    - üî≤ File back end?
    - üî≤ Encrypted cookie back end.
  - ‚úÖ CSRF tokens.
    - ‚úÖ Needs deps looked at.
    - ‚úÖ Needs work in general: code cleanup, more scopes, real secret.
  - üî≤ SQL connection pools (needs separate packaging).
  - üî≤ Tag generation helpers.
  - üî≤ Form, JSON, file uploader parsers.
    - ‚úÖ Form.
    - üî≤ JSON.
    - üî≤ multipart file upload.
  - üî≤ Client+server localization.
  - üî≤ Static.
    - üî≤ Also provide a package that wraps the static middleware so that we can have an OCaml webserver for local development.
  - üî≤ Length limits.
  - üî≤ Websocket design.
    - Just the helper that responds with a websocket response should also return some kind of connection object that the server can further interact on.
  - From Opium:
    - üî≤ `allow_cors`
    - üî≤ ETag
  - From Sihl:
    - üî≤ cron. Not really a middleware. Should probably recommend something.
    - üî≤ email. Also not middleware. Should also just recommend.
    - üî≤ flash
  - ‚úÖ HTTP/2.0 support (h2)
    - ‚úÖ Needs TLS.
    - ‚úÖ Built-in dev certificates for localhost, and docs on how to get real ones.
  - üõë GraphQL support.
- üî≤ Excellent docs.
  - How to build a single-binary app.
  - Recommendations.
    - Creating empty error responses and decorating them at the top level.
    - Type annotation habits to help type inference.
    - "Where to go from here."
      - How to replace and scale each component.
      - Templates: use TyXML.
      - Scaling up database.
      - Using more of the optional middlewares, like URL templates and localizations.
      - `ppx_yojson_conv`.
      - Explain the super loose coupling throughout the framework.
  - Several example projects.
  - Lots of links to references.
    - But all best practices should be summarized into brief recommendations and examples anyway &mdash; the links are for rationale and for users' research purposes, not for skimping on own docs.
    - OWASP.
    - CSRF, JWT discussions.
    - All kinds of best practices guides, etc.
    - RFCs.
  - Tooltips on things like packages.
  - How to plug in Opium middlewares.
    - Actually, they will become less and less useful over time.
  - How to switch web servers.
  - How to create a single-binary web app.
  - Emphasize no hidden strings leaked anywhere.
- üî≤ Excellent testing framework for apps to use.
  - `request -> response` function tester.
    - This would probably the fastest way, because the HTTP parser (an external component to the project) does not get involved.
    - Need to be able to set the current time, capture log, etc.
    - Probably best done using expect tests, so the user will be encouraged to decorate context keys with metadata at this point, if they want to see more.
      - Then good sanitizers are necessary.
      - Perhaps the framework should also be useful in `ppx_expect`.
    - Good combinators for non-expect testing.
  - End-to-end testing.
    - Provide generators and/or accept raw HTTP requests in the tester.
    - Return the actual responses.
      - Provide useful sanitizers.
- Not included in 1.0.0, but planned eventually:
  - ‚ùå Multicore/effects version.
  - ‚ùå QUIC.
  - ‚ùå h2c support.
  - ‚ùå Migrations.
  - ‚ùå Metadata: route listing, etc.

<!-- doc probably has to become docs for GitHub. -->
